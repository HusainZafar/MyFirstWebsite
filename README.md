# MyFirstWebsite

## The Universe
A website that I had made when I was 13. I was very fascinated by Astronomy and had decided to learn HTML to be able to make a simple website that contained an image and a few lines about the differnt types of objects found in the universe.

It was also my first project related to computers.

The website is live at: [Astronomy](http://husainzafar.pythonanywhere.com/universe/)

<LI>On Jan. 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei's improvements to the telescope enabled humanity to see Jupiter's four largest moons for the first time.<br></LI>
<LI> Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto--the so-called Galilean satellites--were seen by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager on the New Horizons spacecraft during its flyby of Jupiter in late February 2007.<BR></LI>
<LI>Io is notable for its active volcanism, which New Horizons studied extensively.<br></LI>
<LI>On the other hand, Europa's smooth, icy surface likely conceals an ocean of liquid water.</LI>
<LI>Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, has a dirty ice surface cut by fractures and peppered by impact craters.<br></LI>

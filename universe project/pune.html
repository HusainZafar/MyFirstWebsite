<b><h1>City, formerly Poona , Maharashtra; at the junction of the Mula and Mutha rivers. 
Known as the "Queen of the Deccan", Pune is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples. 
The city gained importance as the capital of the Marathas in the seventeenth century. It was temporarily captured by the Mughals but again became the official Maratha capital from 1714 until its fall to the British in 1817. 
It served as the seasonal capital of the Bombay Presidency, and after Independence it is a burgeoning city, expanding in all directions, but especially along the Pune-Mumbai (Bombay) rail and road routes through the industrial townships of Pimpri and Chinchwad.

 
Pune has long been a major education and cultural centre; former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru referred to it as the "Oxford and Cambridge of India". 
In addition to its well-known schools, technical institutions, there are colleges of arts, sciences, teacher training, technology, and medicine, affiliated with the University of Pune (1948).
